# Data-Analytics-US-Accidents
### Storytelling based on traffic accidents data
In this project we analyzed the <b>US Accidents (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) </b>dataset
which contains traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies,
traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.<br>
Through our analysis we uncovered various insights that helped deepen our understanding of traffic accidents.<br>
Our analysis consisted of :
<ul>
<li>Dropping irrelevant attributes</li>
<li>Visualizing the data</li>
<li>Cleaning the data from incorrect or missing values</li>
<li>Normalizing the data in order to be used in machine learning algorithms</li>
<li>Clustering the data to reveal properties of the dataset that were not apparent before</li>
<li>Building machine learning models to strengthen the knowledge we have gathered up until now</li>
</ul>
The project was implemented using <b>Python</b> in the <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> enviroment
